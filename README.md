The most important thing that I've learned during the process of becoming a professional problem solver, is that it's hard to turn off.  With an ever increasing set of demands on your time, should you prove yourself capable, managers who fundamentally don't understand what you do or how hard it is to do it, and an ever increasing number of tools and techniques you need to learn to stay competitive, it's hard to turn off.

Therefore here, I will compile a set of recommendations for how I turn off:

1. Structures escapism:

Build time into your day or your week where you do something "dumb".  This is like a guilty pleasure or something inherently easy or simple or dumb.  My favorite example of this is bad tv.  My current example of this is the show the arrow.  The show has predictable story arcs that don't make me think predictably hard.  Nor do the characters have a high amount of depth.  The ways characters interact is often stilted and the main character often has his shirt off when deciding what to do next.  Also, predictably everyone on the show is very attractive.
